# HackPad Project Documentation Prompt

## Recommended Project Title

**Creating a HackPad (Macropad) from Scratch — A Zero-to-One Electronics Learning Project**

---

## Description

This project documents the process of designing and learning to build a HackPad (Macropad) from scratch, starting with near-zero prior knowledge of electronics. The documentation is derived from conversational exploration, decision-making, mistakes, redesigns, and learning moments recorded over time.

The document emphasizes traceability, critical reflection, and structured learning rather than speed or polish.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project documentation is to:

- Record learning progress with precise time and date tracking
- Identify knowledge gaps, reasoning errors, and weak assumptions
- Improve future electronics and embedded systems projects
- Build correct mental models of electronics fundamentals
- Enable post-project reflection and iterative improvement
- Serve as a long-term personal reference and learning log

## Master Prompt

> **Prompt:**  
> Generate a comprehensive, strictly structured **Markdown (.md) project report** documenting our entire conversation for the personal learning project titled:  
> **“Creating a HackPad (Macropad) from scratch with no prior electronics background.”**
>
> This report is intended for **self-reflection and technical documentation**, with the explicit goal of improving learning efficiency, reasoning quality, and project execution over time.
>
> ---
>
> ## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
> - Output must be **valid Markdown (.md)** suitable for long-term version control
> - Tone must be **strict, analytical, and improvement-focused**
> - Assume the learner begins with **near-zero electronics knowledge**
> - Explicitly identify mistakes, weak assumptions, reasoning errors, and inefficiencies
> - Use **qualitative analysis only**
> - Convert all timestamps to **Pakistan Standard Time (Islamabad)**
> - **Do not fabricate missing information**
>
> ### Incomplete Data Rule
> If required information (dates, times, milestones, confirmations) is missing,  
> **STOP and request the missing information from the user before writing the report.**
