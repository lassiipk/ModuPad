## Update

### 🔧 Soldering Iron
I ordered the soldering iron through my **18$ Grant** on **5 January 2026**.  
It was delivered on **17 January 2026** and received by me on **19 January 2026**.  
Total time in transit was **14 days**.

### 🧩 PCB & Components
The **PCB order has been placed** and is currently on its way.  
I also received an **email confirmation** stating that all required pad components have been shipped.

### 🖨️ 3D-Printed Case
The 3D-printed case was delayed due to issues with the grant during the purchasing phase.  
These issues are now resolved, and **the print payment has been confirmed and completed**.  
The order is ready to proceed.

### ✅ Status
The project is now clear of purchasing issues, and I am excited to complete it as soon as the remaining parts arrive.
