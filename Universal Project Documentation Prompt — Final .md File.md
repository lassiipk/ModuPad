# Universal Project Documentation Prompt

## Description

This document defines a reusable, project-agnostic prompt for documenting any learning-based or technical project. It is designed for self-reflection, long-term documentation, and continuous improvement across multiple domains.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this universal prompt is to:

- Standardize documentation across projects
- Improve reasoning quality and learning efficiency
- Capture mistakes, assumptions, and redesigns
- Enable post-project reflection and iteration
- Build transferable skills through structured analysis

---

## Master Prompt

> **Prompt:**  
> Generate a comprehensive, strictly structured **Markdown (.md) project report** documenting our entire conversation for a personal learning project.
>
> This report is intended for **self-reflection and long-term documentation**, with the goal of improving learning efficiency, reasoning quality, and project execution.
>
> ---
>
> ## Hard Constraints
> - Output must be **valid Markdown (.md)**
> - Tone must be **strict, analytical, and improvement-driven**
> - Explicitly identify mistakes, assumptions, reasoning errors, and inefficiencies
> - Use **qualitative evaluation only**
> - Convert all timestamps to the user’s specified time zone
> - **Do not fabricate missing information**
>
> ### Incomplete Data Rule
> If required information (dates, times, milestones, confirmations) is missing,  
> **STOP and request the missing information before writing the report.**
>

>
> ## Mandatory Report Structure
>
> ### 1. Project Overview
> - Project goal and scope
> - Initial skill level and constraints
> - Why the project matters
>
> ### 2. Planning
> - Explicit plans
> - Implicit assumptions
> - Missing or flawed planning
>
> ### 3. Execution & Progress
> - What was done
> - What was assumed but not done
> - Partial vs full progress
>
> ### 4. Redesigns & Direction Changes
> - What changed and why
> - Impact on learning and execution
>
> ### 5. Challenges & Friction
> - Technical difficulties
> - Cognitive and reasoning issues
> - Communication problems
>
> ### 6. Timeline & Traceability
> - Day and time of messages, decisions, learning moments, and actions
> - Lag between intent, understanding, and execution
>
> ### 7. Learning Outcomes
> - Explicit learning
> - Implicit learning
> - Missed learning opportunities
>
> ### 8. Mistake & Assumption Analysis
> - Knowledge gaps
> - Execution errors
> - Reasoning failures
>
> ### 9. Confidence vs Understanding
> - Overconfidence
> - Underconfidence
> - Impact on outcomes
>
> ### 10. External Research Gaps
> - Where research was required but skipped
> - Consequences
>
> ### 11. Cause–Effect Evaluation
> - What accelerated progress
> - What slowed progress and why
>
> ### 12. Post-Completion Review
> - Improvements visible only after completion
>
> ### 13. Improved Version Proposal
> - How the next version would differ
> - How improvements would be implemented
>
> ### 14. Concept Glossary
> - Key terms encountered
> - Beginner-friendly definitions
>
> ### 15. Future Prompts
> - Suggested research prompts
> - Suggested clarification questions
>
> ### 16. Improvement Recommendations
> - How future projects should improve
> - How planning and learning should evolve
>

> **Final Instruction:**  
> Prioritize accuracy, traceability, and learning value over convenience or speed.
