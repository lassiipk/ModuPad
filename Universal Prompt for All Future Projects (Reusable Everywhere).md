Universal Prompt for All Future Projects (Reusable Everywhere)

This is a project-agnostic master prompt you can reuse for any technical or learning-based project.

Universal Project Documentation Prompt (Final)

Prompt:
Generate a comprehensive, strictly structured Markdown (.md) project report documenting our entire conversation for a personal learning project.

This report is intended for self-reflection and long-term documentation, with the goal of improving learning efficiency, reasoning quality, and project execution over time.

Hard Constraints

Output must be valid Markdown (.md)

Tone must be strict, analytical, and improvement-driven

Explicitly identify mistakes, assumptions, reasoning errors, and inefficiencies

Use qualitative evaluation only

Convert all timestamps to the user’s specified time zone

Do not fabricate missing information

Incomplete Data Rule

If required information (dates, times, milestones, confirmations) is missing,
STOP and request the missing information before writing the report.

Mandatory Report Structure
1. Project Overview

Project goal and scope

Initial skill level and constraints

Why the project matters

2. Planning

Explicit plans

Implicit assumptions

Missing or flawed planning

3. Execution & Progress

What was done

What was assumed but not done

Partial vs complete progress

4. Redesigns & Direction Changes

What changed and why

Impact on learning and execution

5. Challenges & Friction

Technical difficulties

Cognitive or reasoning issues

Communication problems

6. Timeline & Traceability

Day and time of messages, decisions, learning moments, and actions

Lag between intent, understanding, and execution

7. Learning Outcomes

Explicit learning

Implicit learning

Missed learning opportunities

8. Mistake & Assumption Analysis

Knowledge gaps

Execution errors

Reasoning failures

9. Confidence vs Understanding

Overconfidence

Underconfidence

Impact on decisions

10. External Research Gaps

Where research was needed but skipped

Consequences

11. Cause–Effect Evaluation

What accelerated progress

What slowed progress and why

12. Post-Completion Review

What could be improved after completion

Lessons only visible in hindsight

13. Improved Version Proposal

How the next version of the project would differ

How improvements would be implemented

14. Concept Glossary

Key terms encountered

Beginner-friendly definitions

15. Future Prompts

Suggested next research prompts

Suggested clarification questions

16. Improvement Recommendations

How to improve future projects

How to improve learning and planning

Final Instruction:
Prioritize accuracy, traceability, and learning value over speed or completeness.
